Using the Spotify data set, conduct an analysis to find trends and key information that could be used by an organisation for future projects.

> By comparing the acoustics and popularity we can see that there is a slight negative correlation between the two, the music with the highest acoustic levels were generally less popular than the ones with a lower acoustic level. Then by comparing this to a graph that displays the energy levels, we can see that the more acoustic music tends to produce lower levels of energy in comparison to the others. We also have a positive correlation in the energy and popularity, which tells us that people engage with high energy music much more.


2: Using the Health data set, conduct an analysis to find trends and key information that could be used by an organisation for future support.

>Through my investigation I have found that Men are more likely to get the cancer types that are displayed in this data set. I have achieved this via adding up all the cancer types and applying them per continent and seeing how the gender is affected. To try to keep the results as accurate as possible I divided the cancer rates by the populations, as countries like Asia have a far higher population which will increase their rates. It is also important to consider different health laws, accessibility and regulations can affect different continents results. The NHS could use this data to try to figure out what differs between genders in order to increase the cancer rates and try to treat them respectfully.
