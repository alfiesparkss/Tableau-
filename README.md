> By comparing the acoustics and popularity we can see that there is a slight negative correlation between the two, the music with the highest acoustic levels were generally less popular than the ones with a lower acoustic level. Then by comparing this to a graph that displays the energy levels, we can see that the more acoustic music tends to produce lower levels of energy in comparison to the others. We also have a positive correlation in the energy and popularity, which tells us that people engage with high energy music much more.
